The Dark side Of The Internet

In his article,  James Bridle concluded that  the videos dedicated to children on YouTube are mostly generated automatically and that the children watching well known videos that are labelled safe for kids can easily be sucked in this YouTube algorithm of videos related to the topic they are watching initially and end up watching one of those bot generated videos which the safety of the content is not always assured.
For my project and with my busy work schedule that can’t permit me to fully explore and experience all the jQuery libraries and what they do, I decided to stick with what I saw and learned in class , using jQuery UI, Anyang and responsive voice script to create a game that is intended for children but that easily turn into a more scary and not so safe game anymore, starting with kid friendly visuals and music and turning into a more scary and less friendly visuals, the program will also speak to the user and give some warnings.  Since I found myself more comfortable with the draggable and droppable elements of jQuery Ui I decided to continue exploring these possibilities and take the idea of my first project and re transform and upgrade it into something more complicated and more interactive.
So for the intro page I used a video background with some explanation on the game and the option to click or to say START for the game to begin, also for all the rounds you have the possibilities to advance by clicking or voice command. I had challenges on finding how to make the voice recognition work without having to click on the page first, I couldn’t figure it out for that reason in order for Annyang to understand the first START command there must be a click anywhere on the page first. The game starts off with a simple papa pig puzzle and some kid music, but the computer will say messages as well according to the stage of the game you are in, and for this I used the UK English voice with a low pitch and low rate value to achieve a more scary computer generated voice, so you better listen carefully. And after completing stage 1 and 2 I was able with JavaScript code to show and hide some images and make them move randomly across the screen with a function that I found online and modified it to my needs and integrated it in my program.
You will see that each stage gets darker and darker and the messages becomes more alarming, this is meant to mimic the more dangerous videos that kids can stumble on just by starting to watch something safe and kid friendly.
After completing the last stage, a scary background image will show and also a final text will be typed on screen with the voice reading the message, for this effect I also looked online for a typewriter effect in Jquery, after finding a couple and mixing and matching the codes and values I was able to achieve the typewriter effect and tried my best to synchronise the typing with the talking voice.
